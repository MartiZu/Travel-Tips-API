# Travel Tips API
My Idea it to display a location (random or picked by the user), with a best time to visit and a fun fact about the location. In a world super accessible and where people travel, it is a fun idea to have a random tip about a place you might want to visit and decide to book your next trip.
#I want to add a "What not to miss" and "Highlights" of the trip

What you need to do: 
1. in the terminal install the packages with the command
     npm install
2. run the server in the terminal with the command
     npm run dev
3. open the html page with live server
4. click the random button or click the pick a city and enter the city you wish to display
5. HAVE FUN!
